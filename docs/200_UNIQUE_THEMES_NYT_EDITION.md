## NYT Editorial Notes

**What Makes These Themes Special:**
- Each theme tells a story that unfolds in 5 words
- Cultural references span from bodega coffee to Beethoven
- Difficulty scales from "anyone can play" to "call your physicist friend"
- Seasonal themes can be swapped in for timely relevance
- Every puzzle has that "aha!" moment when the theme clicks

**Theme Selection Philosophy:**
- Monday: Your grandmother could solve it over morning coffee
- Tuesday-Wednesday: Book club difficulty - educated but accessible
- Thursday-Friday: New Yorker reader territory
- Saturday: Wine-and-cheese party conversation level
- Sunday: Faculty lounge at Columbia

**Cultural Touchstones We Love:**
- NPR moments (pledge drive anxiety, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me)
- NYC specifics used sparingly (subway delays, Museum Mile)
- Tech culture (doom scrolling, password fatigue)
- Foodie culture (farm-to-table, natural wine)
- Pandemic pivots (sourdough starters, Zoom fatigue)

Remember: We're not just making word ladders. We're creating tiny cultural artifacts that capture the zeitgeist while remaining timeless enough for the archives.
